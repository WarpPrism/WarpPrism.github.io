感想： 作者在文章中传达的信息是充满整能量的：与他人分享你所拥有的东西。是的，分享这个词传达的就是一种利他主义，在便利他人的同时，自己也收获了很多快乐，这种乐于分享的精神十分难能可贵。

我们这个世界本身就是一个资源分配不公平的社会，这种不公平性有时候不是人为因素导致的，恰恰是一些偶然因素造成了资源，知识，经验分配的不公。如果我们都站出来，把自己所拥有的知识，经验，方法分享出来，那么这个社会就会消除不公，走向和谐。

对于程序员的世界，这种分享的精神尤为重要。开源精神就是一种分享精神，开源能让所有的开发者欣赏你程序的内在美，也能让所有的开发者有机会指出你代码的疏漏，帮助你提高。就好比你写了一篇优美的散文，刊登在杂志上，每个读者都可以欣赏这篇文章，获得心灵上的慰藉。所以我愿做一个开源的开发者，一个心境开放的人，把我学到的知识与别人分享，我觉得这就是一种快乐。如果有别的同学问问题，我会尽我所能地予以解答，而不是简单搪塞，让别人自己查资料。也许自己不经意的一句话就会让别人省去很多时间，更快地完成工作。

最后，希望越来越多的人能成为一个**乐于分享**的人，而不是把知识封装在自己世界中的人。

以下是正文：

I feel like I know almost nothing about business, because the only business I’ve ever done is the co-op sharing model.

It goes like this:

**1.You already have something that people want.**

It might be something you own, something you’ve learned how to do, or access to valuable resources, space, or people.

**2.Find a way to share it with everyone who needs it.**

Share because it’s what you do for friends, because it’s the right thing to do, because it makes the world a better place, and because it’ll make you deeply happy.

Share as your contribution in return for all the things and ideas that people have shared with you.

(If you’re having a bad day, or someone has recently wronged you, you may not feel the world has shared much with you, but here’s a reminder.)

**3.If it takes some effort for you to share it, you can charge a little something for your effort, to ensure that this giving can continue.**

### **My examples:** ###

**(1)** In 1994, the U.S. Copyright office still didn’t have their copyright forms online. You still had to mail a letter to Washington DC to ask them to mail you some blank forms, if you wanted to copyright your songs.
I scanned all the forms, and put them on my website for free as printable downloads, for any musician who needed them.
For the next year or two, until the government started putting the forms online, my site was the only place to get them. This was my first effort to contribute back to this great invention of the internet.


**(2)** In 1995, I learned how to trademark my band name. It took many hours of work to figure out the legalese, but I did it.
I wrote out the step-by-step instructions and put them on my band’s website for free.
For years it was the go-to resource for musicians who wanted to trademark their name.


**(3)** In 1996, I had a little record label, so I got a UPC barcode account, so I could put unique UPC barcodes on my CDs. I had to pay $750 to the Universal Code Council to get a company account, but that meant I was allowed to create 100,000 products under my account. Musician friends asked how, so I showed them how, but also said they could use one of my product IDs.
At first, I did this for free, as a favor, until friends started sending strangers my way. Because it took a little work to generate the number, create their EPS/TIFF graphic barcode, and keep track of their unique IDs forever, I charged $20.
Over the next 12 years, this made me almost $2 million.


**(4)** In 1997, I got a credit card merchant account to sell my own CD at live shows. It cost $1000 in set-up fees and took three months of red-tape paperwork. Then I built a little online shopping cart, which also took months of work, just to sell my own CD. Musician friends asked if they could use mine instead of having to go through all of that work, so I said OK.
At first, I did this for free, as a favor, until it was taking up all of my time. Because it took me 45 minutes of work to digitize, stock, set up a new album in my system, I charged $35 per new album. Because it took 10 minutes of work to pick, pack, and ship a purchased CD, I charged $4 per CD sold.
Over the next 12 years, this made me about $20 million.


**(5)** In 1999, I had learned a lot about hosting websites. Linux, Apache, PHP, SQL, FTP, DNS, Qmail, SpamAssassin, etc. I had done it for myself for my band’s website, then for CD Baby, and bought my own servers. So when friends would complain about their existing web-hosting company, I’d host them on my servers instead.
At first, I did this for free, as a favor, until it was filling up my server. Because each server cost me $300/month, and I had to hire a full-time person to manage this, I charged $20 per month. (In 1999 this was way cheap.)
Over the next 9 years, this made me about $5 million.


**(6)** Since 2000, I’ve been sharing everything I’ve learned for free. I’m not the smartest guy, probably below average, but it costs nothing to share, and it’s the right thing to do, so I do.
Over the last 11 years, this made me incredibly happy and lucky, because of all the interesting people I’ve met by doing it.


### **Point being:** ###

None of these things looked like a business venture.

All of them were just sharing something I already had.

People often ask me if I have any suggestions for what kind of business they should get into.

I tell them the only thing I know how to recommend: “Start by sharing whatever you’ve got.”
